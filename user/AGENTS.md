# User Agent Rules

Custom rules and preferences for the on-device agent.
The agent reads system rules from `$sys/docs/AGENTS.md` first,
then this file for your additions and overrides.

## Migration Note

If `AGENTS.bak.md` exists, it contains the previous version of this file
(saved during an app upgrade). Review it for any custom rules worth keeping,
copy them into "My Rules" below, then delete the `.bak.md` file.

## My Rules

(Add your custom rules here. These persist across app upgrades.)
