    summary: Get me.me status and peer presence
    description: >
      Returns self profile plus current peer/discovery summary.
      Includes peer presence/connection snapshots and discovery runtime state.
      Discovery and route selection are automatic (LAN/BLE/gateway fallback);
      agents should not orchestrate low-level transport.

    summary: Send encrypted content to a peer
    description: >
      Send structured content to a peer device using automatic route
      selection (LAN/BLE/gateway fallback). Supports multiple payload formats:

      - Preferred: `{"peer_device_id":"...","type":"message","payload":{...}}`

      - Text shortcut: `{"peer_device_id":"...","text":"..."}`

      - Backward compat: `{"peer_device_id":"...","message":"..."}` (string normalized to payload.text)

      - Object shortcut: `{"peer_device_id":"...","message":{"type":"...","...":...}}` (type becomes message type)


      Connection security: offer token signed with Ed25519 (fallback ECDSA P-256),
      session key from X25519 (fallback ECDH P-256) + HKDF-SHA256,
      payload encrypted with AES-GCM.


      Inbound content arrives as `me.me.received` events forwarded to
      `/brain/inbox/event` with fields: received_origin (peer|external),
      received_transport (lan|ble|gateway), received_provider (direct|generic|<name>),
      received_kind (message|audio|discord.message|slack.event|...).
