# User Tool Notes

Custom tool notes and preferences.
The agent reads the system tool reference from `$sys/docs/TOOLS.md` first,
then this file for your additions.

## Migration Note

If `TOOLS.bak.md` exists, it contains the previous version of this file
(saved during an app upgrade). Review it for any custom notes worth keeping,
copy them into "My Notes" below, then delete the `.bak.md` file.

## My Notes

(Add your custom notes here. These persist across app upgrades.)
